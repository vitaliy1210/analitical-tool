# ANALYTICAL TOOL
This project is a tool for customer support app which takes as argument
a String with the following format and conditions to the task.

### Input
The company provides 10 different services, each with 3 variations. Questions are divided into
10 types, each can belong to 20 categories, a category can have 5 subcategories.

First line contains count S (<= 100.000) of all lines.
Every line starts with character C (waiting timeline) or D (query).

### Waiting timeline:

C service_id[.variation_id] question_type_id[.category_id.[sub-category_id]] P/N date time

Values in square brackets are optional.
service_id[.variation_id] - service 9.1 represent service 9 of variation 1.
question_type_id[.category_id.[sub-category_id]] - question type 7.14.4 represent question type 7
category 14 and sub-category 4.
P/N - response type ‘P’ (first answer) or ‘N’ (next answer).
date - response date format is DD.MM.YYYY, for example, 27.11.2012 (27.november 2012).
time - time in minutes represent waiting time.

### Query line:

D service_id[.variation_id] question_type_id[.category_id.[sub-category_id]] P/N date_from[-date_to]
Represent query, it prints out the average waiting time of all records matching specific criteria.
service_id and question_type_id can have special value “*”, it means query match all
services/question types. In the case of value “*”, neither service variation nor service
category/subcategory can be specified.

### Output
Query line of type ‘D’ print out average waiting time rounded to minutes.
Only matching lines defined before the query line is counted.
It prints out “-” if the output is not defined.
### Example
#### Input:
7 \
C 1.1 8.15.1 P 15.10.2012 83\
C 1 10.1 P 01.12.2012 65\
C 1.1 5.5.1 P 01.11.2012 117\
D 1.1 8 P 01.01.2012-01.12.2012\
C 3 10.2 N 02.10.2012 100\
D 1 * P 8.10.2012-20.11.2012\
D 3 10 P 01.12.2012\

#### Output:
83
100
-
#### Explanation:
**1.query** ( D 1.1 8 P 01.01.2012-01.12.2012 ) at line 5:
Valid only for 1.data line, because others have different question type.
1.data line has question type 8.15.1 which matches the query of question type 8.
Result: 83.

**2.query** ( D 1 * P 8.10.2012-20.11.2012 ) at line 7:
Valid only for 1.data line and 3.data line.
2.data line doesn’t match the date filter.
4.data line has a different response type (D).
5.data line doesn’t match service, response type, and data filter.
Result: (83+117)/2=100.

**3.query** ( D 3 10 P 01.12.2012 ) at line 8:
Doesn’t match any data line.
Result: “-”.
